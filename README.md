You can upload a file easily:

... or if the blob path's ends with `/` than it'll use the name of the file.

Uploading `LICENSE.pdf` into `path/LICENSE.pdf` ... OK
```

If you want to upload full directories than you have to define the `--recursive` parameter.

```bash
$ azrcmd-put --recursive azurcmd/ wasbc://container@path/
Uploading `azrcmd/azrcmd/__init__.py` into `path/azrcmd/__init__.py` ... OK
Uploading `azrcmd/setup.py` into `path/setup.py` ... OK
```
